# 🏥 Medical Appointment System (Java Console Project)

This is a simple **Java console-based Medical Appointment System** that allows doctors, patients, and admins to manage appointments efficiently. The project is built using the **MVC architecture**, follows **OOP principles**, and stores data using **Java Collections**. This was created as my **first hands-on project** to understand Java concepts more deeply.
